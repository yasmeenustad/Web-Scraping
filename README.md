## Web scraping can be useful for a variety of purposes, including:
1. Data aggregation: Gathering data from multiple sources for analysis, such as news articles, product prices, or social media posts.
2. Research and monitoring: Collecting data for academic or market research, tracking prices of products or services, or monitoring changes on websites.
3. Content extraction: Extracting specific information from websites, such as contact details, reviews, or job postings.
4. Machine learning training data: Gathering data to train machine learning models, such as collecting images or text from various sources.

## Libraries used for Web Scraping are:
### 1. Requests:
The Requests library is used for sending HTTP requests in Python. It simplifies the process of making GET and POST requests to a web server and receiving responses. It allows you to download the HTML content of web pages.

### 2. BeautifulSoup: 
BeautifulSoup is a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It provides methods to extract data from parsed documents using various techniques, such as searching by tags, attributes, or CSS selectors. BeautifulSoup helps in navigating and manipulating the HTML structure of web pages.

## Data Cleaning:
Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing or data scrubbing, refers to the process of identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in datasets. It involves transforming raw data into a clean and reliable format suitable for analysis or other data-driven tasks.
